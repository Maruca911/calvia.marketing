    excerpt:
      'A practical, step-by-step AI marketing playbook for Mallorca businesses: prompts, workflows, local SEO, ads, email, and reputation systems with sources.',
    content: `<p><strong>AI marketing Mallorca</strong> is simplest when you treat AI like a junior teammate: it can draft, organize, summarize, and propose options, but you remain responsible for accuracy, compliance, and quality. Used well, AI helps local businesses in Calvià and across Mallorca publish better information, reply faster, and run tighter campaigns without turning your brand into generic “AI copy”. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>This playbook is written for restaurants, hotels, tourism operators, and local services. It’s designed to be implemented in small steps, with a focus on crawlable content, trustworthy citations, and systems you can repeat every week.</p>

<h2>What “AI marketing” means (in plain English)</h2>
<p>AI marketing is the use of AI tools to support marketing tasks like research, planning, writing, personalization, and optimization. The goal is not to publish more content; the goal is to publish <em>more helpful</em> content, faster, with a clear review process. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Where AI is most useful for Mallorca local businesses</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local visibility:</strong> Google Business Profile posts, descriptions, service lists, and review replies (with policy-safe language). <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Demand capture:</strong> Google Ads copy variations, keyword clustering, negative keyword lists, landing-page QA checklists. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Content systems:</strong> topic clusters, outlines, FAQs, internal linking plans, and editorial calendars that match search intent. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> segmented email drafts by language and season, plus review-request templates that avoid “fake engagement”. <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>The non-negotiables: quality, policies, and trust</h2>
<p>If you want AI-assisted content to perform in Google, you need to anchor it in people-first usefulness, original local context, and verifiable sourcing. Google’s guidance emphasizes helpful, reliable content and warns against using automation primarily to manipulate rankings. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Rule 1: Don’t publish unreviewed AI output</h3>
<p>AI can produce confident mistakes. Your review checklist should include: factual accuracy, pricing accuracy, location accuracy (Calvià vs Palma vs island-wide), and policy compliance (ads, reviews, business profiles).</p>

<h3>Rule 2: Cite sources for important claims</h3>
<p>When you reference platform rules, features, or measurable facts, add citations and list sources. This is not just “SEO”, it’s reader trust. Google’s people-first guidance explicitly points to sourcing and credibility signals as part of building trust. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Rule 3: Create with intent, not volume</h3>
<p>If you use AI to mass-produce pages to catch keywords, that’s a bad strategy. Google’s guidance on AI content makes the point that automation isn’t “banned”, but using it to manipulate search rankings is against spam policies. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Set up your “AI marketing inputs” once (then reuse them)</h2>
<p>The fastest way to get high-quality AI output is to stop prompting from scratch every time. Build a small internal “brand kit” that you paste into prompts.</p>

<h3>1) Your offer library (copy/paste)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Top 3 offers (what you sell)</li>
  <li>Top 3 customer problems you solve</li>
  <li>Top 3 differentiators (proof, not hype)</li>
  <li>Constraints (opening hours, service area, pricing boundaries, what you don’t do)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Your brand voice (10 lines)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Language mix: English/Spanish/German (choose the priority order)</li>
  <li>Tone: calm, premium, friendly, direct</li>
  <li>Words you always use (and words you never use)</li>
  <li>Level of formality (tourists vs residents vs B2B)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Your policy checklist</h3>
<p>Keep links to official policies you must follow. For example, Google’s Business Profile guidelines help you avoid risky edits, keyword stuffing in names, and other issues that can trigger restrictions. <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h2>A 7-day implementation plan (realistic for a small team)</h2>

<h3>Day 1: Pick one “topic cluster” to own</h3>
<p>Choose one category to build topical authority. If you’re a Mallorca restaurant, that might be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“best restaurant in [area]” supporting pages</li>
  <li>menu and dietary pages (gluten-free, vegan)</li>
  <li>events, live music, group bookings</li>
</ul>
<p>On Calvia Marketing, we structure content into categories and hubs (example: <a href="/category/ai-marketing">AI Marketing</a>) so both users and crawlers can follow the topic path.</p>

<h3>Day 2: Publish one “evergreen” guide and link it internally</h3>
<p>Create one long, evergreen guide that answers a high-intent question. Then add internal links from related pages. (Start with the Knowledge Base: <a href="/knowledge-base">browse all guides</a>.)</p>

<h3>Day 3: Improve your Google Business Profile (GBP) content</h3>
<p>Write a clean business description, add services/products, and start a weekly post routine. Google documents how posts work and what can get posts rejected. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Day 4: Set up conversion tracking before spending on ads</h3>
<p>If you run Google Ads, start by measuring what matters (leads, bookings, purchases). Google’s conversion setup guide walks through web conversion measurement and tagging options. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Day 5: Build a review reply system (human-first, policy-safe)</h3>
<p>Reviews influence trust. Your system should respond quickly, keep the tone consistent, and avoid policy violations like incentivized review manipulation (“fake engagement”). <sup><a href="#source-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Day 6: Create a simple bilingual email cadence</h3>
<p>Tourism businesses often need language segmentation. Use AI to draft variants, but keep consent and compliance in mind (GDPR). <sup><a href="#source-10">[10]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Day 7: Audit and iterate</h3>
<p>Look at what got traction (search queries, bookings, calls, replies). Tighten what works, delete what doesn’t, and keep the system small enough to sustain.</p>

<h2>Prompt template: the “Mallorca Marketing Operator”</h2>
<p>Use this as a starting point and replace the brackets with your real inputs.</p>

<pre><code>You are my marketing operator for a local business in Mallorca.

Business: [type, location, offer]
Audience: [tourists, residents, expats]
Languages: [English/Spanish/German], priority order
Brand voice: [3-5 traits]
Constraints: [hours, pricing, service area, claims to avoid]
Sources: when you reference a platform rule or feature, include the official URL.

Task:
1) Propose 5 content ideas for the next 2 weeks (SEO + GBP + social).
2) For each idea, give a draft outline with H2/H3 headings.
3) Suggest 5 internal links to existing pages on my site.
4) Suggest 3 external sources to cite where relevant.
</code></pre>

<p>Prompt engineering basics: be specific, put constraints early, and ask for a structured output you can review quickly. <sup><a href="#source-11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Channel-by-channel workflows (templates you can reuse)</h2>
<p>Most local businesses don’t need a complex “AI stack”. You need 3-5 repeatable workflows that move the needle: visibility, trust, demand capture, and retention. The templates below are designed to keep output useful and policy-safe. They also make your content more crawlable and easier to cite. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Workflow A: AI-assisted SEO article (2 hours)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pick one query:</strong> a question your customers ask (e.g., “best time to book”, “what to expect”, “pricing”, “areas we serve”).</li>
  <li><strong>Draft an outline:</strong> ask AI for H2/H3 headings and an internal link plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Add local proof:</strong> add real Mallorca details (seasonality, neighborhoods, booking windows, local rules).</li>
  <li><strong>Add citations:</strong> when you reference platform rules, link to the official docs. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Quality check:</strong> remove fluff, check accuracy, then publish and link it from related pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Update monthly:</strong> refresh the intro and add 1 new section based on real questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google’s guidance on helpful content and AI-assisted content strongly implies the same standard: produce useful pages for people and avoid automation designed to manipulate rankings. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Workflow B: Local SEO weekly pack (45 minutes)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>One GBP Update post:</strong> what’s new this week (availability, seasonal info, menu updates). <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>One GBP Offer/Event post:</strong> only if real (no fake urgency).</li>
  <li><strong>One “FAQ asset” on your website:</strong> add 3-5 FAQs and link from your related service page.</li>
  <li><strong>Review replies:</strong> respond to negative reviews first, then detailed positive reviews.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep your profile edits compliant with Google’s Business Profile guidelines (especially names, categories, addresses, and content). <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Workflow C: Google Ads testing loop (90 minutes/week)</h3>
<p><strong>Start with tracking.</strong> Only optimize what you can measure. Google’s conversion setup docs cover web conversion tracking. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> tighten keywords + negatives (reduce wasted spend)</li>
  <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> test 2 ad angles (benefit vs proof vs urgency)</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> improve landing page message match</li>
  <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> scale only what converts</li>
</ul>
<p>Use AI to generate variations for Responsive Search Ads (RSAs), but keep claims truthful and consistent with the landing page. <sup><a href="#source-12">[12]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Workflow D: Reputation replies (20 minutes/day)</h3>
<p>Reputation management is part of marketing. Use AI to draft replies, then apply a human review pass. Avoid policy violations like fake engagement or prohibited content. <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h2>AI publishing checklist (copy/paste)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> are locations, prices, and policies correct?</li>
  <li><strong>Intent:</strong> does the page answer the query without filler?</li>
  <li><strong>Originality:</strong> did you add local, real details (not generic travel copy)?</li>
  <li><strong>Links:</strong> at least 3 internal links to related guides + 1-3 external citations where needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> no misleading claims, no “review incentives”, no policy violations. <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>UX:</strong> mobile readable, clear CTA, fast loading.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topical authority: internal links that compound</h2>
<p>Think in “hubs” and “spokes”. Your hub is a category page (example: <a href="/category/ai-marketing">AI Marketing</a>). Spokes are detailed guides that link back to the hub and to each other where relevant. This helps users navigate and helps crawlers understand topical relationships. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>How to add citations (the simple method)</h3>
<p>When you reference a platform rule (Google Ads, Google Business Profile, policies) or a factual statement, add an inline footnote like <code>[1]</code> that links to your Sources section. Readers can verify your claim, and you avoid “trust me” marketing. Start by citing primary documentation first, then use reputable research only when it adds real value. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

    excerpt:
      'Copy/paste prompt templates to plan, write, and optimize Google Ads for Mallorca businesses, with policy-safe constraints, tracking first, and better landing pages.',
    content: `<p><strong>ChatGPT prompts for Google Ads</strong> work best when you use them to generate <em>options</em>, not final answers. Your job is to provide the constraints (offer, location, pricing, legal/brand rules) and then review the output for truthfulness and policy compliance. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>This guide gives you a practical prompt kit for restaurants, hotels, and local services in Mallorca. It pairs prompts with a process so you don’t end up with generic ads or campaigns that burn budget without tracking.</p>

<h2>Before you write ads: set up measurement</h2>
<p>If you don’t have conversion tracking, you’re guessing. Google’s setup guide covers web conversion measurement and ways to connect your site (Google tag, Google Analytics). <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Minimum conversions to track for local businesses:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Form submits (lead, booking request)</li>
  <li>Phone clicks (mobile)</li>
  <li>Bookings/purchases (if you have them)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prompt 0: Build your campaign brief (inputs)</h2>
<pre><code>Act as a Google Ads strategist.

Business: [restaurant/hotel/service], location: [Calvià/Magaluf/Santa Ponsa/etc]
Offer: [what you sell], price range: [€€-€€€]
Audience: [tourists/residents/expats], languages: [EN/ES/DE]
Seasonality: [high season months], constraints: [no discount claims, no "best", etc.]
Landing page URL: [link]

Task:
1) Ask me 15 questions you need answered before building campaigns.
2) Then propose a simple campaign structure: 2-4 campaigns, 2-6 ad groups each.
3) Include conversion goals and what to exclude (negative intent).
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 1: Keyword clustering (Mallorca intent)</h2>
<p>Use Keyword Planner for real volume/ideas, then use AI to cluster into ad groups. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>Cluster these keywords into tight ad groups. Output as a table:
Ad group name | keywords | match type suggestion | negative keywords | landing page angle.

Keywords:
[paste list]

Business context:
[paste your offer + location + audience]
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 2: Negative keyword brainstorm (budget protection)</h2>
<pre><code>Create a negative keyword list for this business:
Business: [type]
We DO NOT want: [jobs, cheap, free, DIY, wholesales, etc.]
We DO want: [bookings, reservations, near me, open now]

Output:
1) Universal negatives
2) Category-specific negatives
3) "Research intent" negatives
4) Competitor intent negatives (optional)
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 3: Responsive Search Ad (RSA) pack with character limits</h2>
<p>Responsive search ads let you provide multiple headlines and descriptions, and Google tests combinations. The RSA help page includes asset limits and recommends writing assets that make sense in any order. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>Create 1 Responsive Search Ad.

Rules:
- 15 headlines, max 30 characters each
- 4 descriptions, max 90 characters each
- No unverifiable claims (no "best", no fake awards)
- Mention location naturally (Mallorca / Calvià / Santa Ponsa where relevant)
- Include at least 3 different value props and 2 calls-to-action
- Output each line with a character count.

Business:
[paste offer + location + differentiators]
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 4: Landing page QA checklist (Quality Score helper)</h2>
<pre><code>Review this landing page for a Google Ads search campaign.

Landing page URL: [paste]
Primary keyword: [paste]

Output:
1) Message match (ad to page)
2) Trust signals to add (local proof, reviews, policies)
3) Friction points (forms, speed, confusing copy)
4) Mobile UX issues
5) A revised hero section (headline + subhead + 3 bullets)
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 5: Restaurant prompts (reservations + events)</h2>
<pre><code>Create ad angles for a Mallorca restaurant.

Inputs:
- Cuisine: [type]
- Location: [area]
- Booking method: [WhatsApp/phone/booking engine]
- Differentiators: [sunset view, live music, kids friendly, vegan]

Output:
1) 5 "reservation intent" angles
2) 5 "group booking" angles
3) 5 "event" angles (seasonal)
Each with: headline idea, description idea, and suggested sitelink text.
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 6: Hotel prompts (direct bookings)</h2>
<pre><code>Create ad copy variations for a Mallorca hotel aiming for direct bookings.

Rules:
- Avoid misleading pricing claims
- Focus on amenities + location + cancellation policy clarity
- Produce: 12 headlines, 4 descriptions, 8 sitelinks (with short descriptions)

Inputs:
[paste hotel info]
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt 7: Local services (leads + qualification)</h2>
<pre><code>Create a lead-gen campaign plan for a local service business in Mallorca.

Service: [plumber/electrician/cleaning]
Service area: [towns]
Emergency vs non-emergency: [rules]

Output:
1) Keyword themes by urgency
2) Ad copy per theme
3) "Bad lead" negatives
4) A phone script for answering calls in 30 seconds
</code></pre>

<h2>How to keep AI ad copy policy-safe</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Feed AI only claims you can prove (prices, availability, policies).</li>
  <li>Avoid “best #1” style superlatives unless you can substantiate them.</li>
  <li>Keep assets meaningful even if Google mixes the order. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
  <li>Track conversions before optimizing. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ad assets (extensions) that local businesses should use</h2>
<p>Most local campaigns improve when you add the right <strong>assets</strong> (formerly called extensions). They increase real estate on the results page and give users more paths to convert. Three core assets to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Location assets:</strong> connect your Business Profile so ads can show address and map signals where available. <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Call assets:</strong> show a call button (especially valuable for mobile “book now” intent). <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Sitelink assets:</strong> add deep links like “Menu”, “Rooms”, “Book”, “Directions”, “Pricing”. <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt: build a full asset pack (sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets)</h3>
<pre><code>Create an asset pack for this Google Ads search campaign.

Business: [type], location: [town], language: [EN/ES/DE]
Offer: [what you sell]

Output:
1) 8 sitelinks (each with a short description)
2) 8 callouts (2-4 words)
3) 4 structured snippets with 4 values each (e.g., "Amenities: ...")
4) 3 phone CTA lines for call assets

Rules:
- No exaggerated claims
- Use clear, specific language
</code></pre>

<h2>Budget + bidding: what AI should (and shouldn’t) decide</h2>
<p>Use AI to propose scenarios, not truths. AI cannot know your real conversion rates. It can help you plan a structure like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Core intent” campaign:</strong> high intent searches (e.g., “book hotel santa ponsa”, “restaurant reservations calvià”)</li>
  <li><strong>“Brand” campaign:</strong> protect your brand name (often cheap, high conversion)</li>
  <li><strong>“Discovery” campaign:</strong> longer-tail queries (lower bids, more learning)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want Mallorca-specific paid search strategy, also read <a href="/article/google-ads-budget-mallorca">Google Ads budget planning</a>, <a href="/article/facebook-ads-vs-google-ads-mallorca">Facebook Ads vs Google Ads</a>, and <a href="/article/lead-generation-ppc-mallorca">PPC lead generation</a>.</p>

<h2>Compliance checklist (avoid avoidable account problems)</h2>
<p>Before launching, review your copy for policy risk. One common issue is <strong>misrepresentation</strong> (misleading claims or implying things you cannot prove). Google documents misrepresentation under its Ads policies. <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t claim “official” or “certified” unless true</li>
  <li>Don’t use fake countdowns or fake urgency</li>
  <li>Don’t promise results you can’t guarantee (“#1”, “best”, “guaranteed”) unless substantiated</li>
  <li>Keep pricing and availability honest and consistent with the landing page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weekly optimization SOP (20 minutes)</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Search terms:</strong> add negatives for irrelevant queries (Prompt 2).</li>
  <li><strong>Ads:</strong> pause the weakest ad angle and write 1 new RSA variation (Prompt 3). <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Assets:</strong> add 1 new sitelink and 2 callouts (Prompt above). <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Landing page:</strong> improve message match or speed (Prompt 4).</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> confirm conversions are still firing. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<h2>Prompt: search terms clean-up + expansion (from your report)</h2>
<p>Once per week, export your search terms and let AI propose two things: what to block (negatives) and what to build (new ad groups). Always review before applying.</p>
<pre><code>Analyze this Google Ads search term report (CSV rows).

Task:
1) Suggest negative keywords (grouped by theme).
2) Suggest 3-5 new ad groups we should create.
3) For each new ad group, write one RSA (15 headlines + 4 descriptions).

Constraints:
- Do not invent claims
- Use location naturally (Mallorca / town)
- Keep output structured and easy to copy

Report:
[paste top rows]
</code></pre>

<h2>Prompt: compliance + truthfulness review (final pass)</h2>
<p>Use this before publishing new ad copy. It forces AI to act like a strict reviewer, not a copywriter. Misrepresentation is a common avoidable risk. <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>Review this ad copy for policy risk and truthfulness.

Inputs:
- Business facts we can prove: [paste]
- Ad copy: [paste headlines/descriptions/assets]
- Landing page claims: [paste]

Output:
1) Any potentially misleading claims (and safer rewrites)
2) Any missing required context (prices, conditions, dates)
3) Any wording that could be considered misrepresentation
4) A final "safe" version of the ad copy
</code></pre>

<h2>Landing page structure that converts for local intent</h2>
<p>Search ads work when the landing page answers the query quickly. For local businesses, a strong landing page usually includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear offer + location:</strong> say what you do and where (Calvià, Santa Ponsa, Palma, island-wide).</li>
  <li><strong>Proof:</strong> reviews, photos, guarantees you can actually honor.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast contact:</strong> tap-to-call and WhatsApp options for mobile users.</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ:</strong> answer objections (parking, booking rules, cancellation, service area).</li>
</ul>
<p>For broader website + SEO structure, see <a href="/article/website-design-seo-mallorca">website design for SEO in Mallorca</a>.</p>

<h2>Mallorca seasonality tip (don’t run the same campaign all year)</h2>
<p>Tourism businesses often have strong swings between off-season and high season. Instead of keeping the same ads and budgets forever, plan a seasonal structure: pre-season “planning” queries, high-season “book now” queries, and off-season “locals/weekend” angles. For a deeper PPC seasonality approach, read <a href="/article/seasonal-ppc-mallorca-tourism">Seasonal PPC for Mallorca tourism</a>.</p>
<p>AI helps here by drafting seasonal ad angles and updating landing-page copy quickly, but you still need real availability, real prices, and tracking to know what’s profitable. Use it to speed up iteration, not to guess performance.</p>

    title: 'AI for Local SEO: Google Business Profile Posts, Q&A, Review Replies',
    slug: 'ai-local-seo-google-business-profile-posts-qa-review-replies',
    excerpt:
      'Use AI to improve local SEO with better Google Business Profile posts, safer review replies, and a Q&A workflow you can manage even after API deprecations.',
    content: `<p><strong>AI for local SEO</strong> is not a trick. It’s a workflow: you use AI to draft posts and replies faster, then you apply a human review pass so the final output is accurate, policy-safe, and genuinely helpful. This matters in Mallorca, where seasonal demand changes quickly and your Google Business Profile (GBP) can be the difference between a booking and a lost customer.</p>

<p>This guide covers three practical workflows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google Business Profile posts (weekly routine)</li>
  <li>Q&amp;A management (manual-first, because the API was discontinued)</li>
  <li>Review replies (fast, human tone, no fake engagement)</li>
</ul>

<h2>1) AI for Google Business Profile posts (weekly routine)</h2>
<p>Google explains the types of posts (updates, offers, events), where they appear, and why posts can be rejected (for example: policy issues or certain content). Use AI to draft, then you edit and publish. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Weekly posting cadence (simple)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mon:</strong> “Update” post (what’s new this week)</li>
  <li><strong>Wed:</strong> “Offer” or “menu highlight” post (if relevant)</li>
  <li><strong>Fri:</strong> “Event/weekend” post</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt: GBP post draft (policy-aware)</h3>
<pre><code>Create 3 Google Business Profile posts for this business.

Business: [type], location: [town], languages: [EN/ES/DE]
Offer: [what you sell]
Constraints:
- No misleading claims
- No keyword stuffing in the business name
- No sensitive personal data

Output:
For each post: type (Update/Offer/Event), title, 1 image idea, body text (max 1500 chars), CTA.
</code></pre>

<p>Keep your profile info accurate and policy-compliant. Google’s “Guidelines for representing your business” are worth reading closely, especially around names, addresses, and content rules. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>2) AI for Q&amp;A: treat it as “public FAQs” (manual-first)</h2>
<p>Historically, Q&amp;A could be managed via API, but Google’s official changelog states the My Business Q&amp;A API was discontinued on November 3, 2025. That means automation via API is no longer an option. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>What to do now:</strong> maintain a public FAQ system you control:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add FAQs to your website (and link them internally)</li>
  <li>Answer recurring questions consistently across channels</li>
  <li>Use AI to draft, but publish answers that reflect your real policies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt: FAQ extraction from customer conversations</h3>
<pre><code>Turn these customer messages into a public FAQ.

Rules:
- Remove personal data
- Keep answers short and specific
- If something depends on season, mention the months
- Output: 10 questions + answers

Messages:
[paste anonymized messages]
</code></pre>

<h2>3) AI review replies that don’t sound robotic (and don’t break policy)</h2>
<p>Reviews are user-generated content. Google’s Maps UGC policy and “Prohibited &amp; restricted content” policy are the guardrails. In particular: don’t incentivize reviews, don’t post fake reviews, and don’t manipulate ratings through “fake engagement”. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Workflow: human-first review replies</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Classify</strong> the review (positive, neutral, negative, scam/off-topic)</li>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> 2 reply options with AI (short + warm; longer + detailed)</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> for accuracy, tone, and privacy</li>
  <li><strong>Publish</strong> and log common issues for operations</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prompt: review reply generator (brand voice)</h3>
<pre><code>Write 2 replies to this review in our brand voice.

Brand voice: [friendly/premium/direct], no emojis, 60-120 words.
Business: [type], location: [town]

Rules:
- Do not mention incentives or discounts for reviews
- Do not include private details about staff/customers
- Offer a next step for resolution when negative (phone/email)

Review:
[paste review]
</code></pre>

<h2>GBP profile foundations (do this before “AI optimization”)</h2>
<p>AI can help you draft text, but it cannot fix basic profile problems like wrong hours, inconsistent addresses, or misleading categories. Start with the fundamentals and use Google’s official Business Profile guidelines as your reference. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Business name:</strong> keep it real (don’t add keywords).</li>
  <li><strong>Primary category:</strong> pick the closest match to your main offer.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary categories/services:</strong> add only what you actually provide.</li>
  <li><strong>Hours:</strong> keep them accurate (especially seasonal hours).</li>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> write for humans, not keyword stuffing.</li>
  <li><strong>Photos:</strong> use real photos (location, product, team) and update regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper GBP setup guide, read <a href="/article/google-business-profile-mallorca">Google Business Profile Mallorca</a> and connect it to <a href="/article/local-seo-mallorca">Local SEO Mallorca</a>.</p>

<h2>Post templates by business type (Mallorca-ready)</h2>
<p>GBP posts work best when they reduce uncertainty: what’s happening, when, where, and how to book. Google’s posting documentation explains how posts work and the constraints. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Restaurants</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Today’s highlight”:</strong> 1 dish + 1 reason + booking CTA.</li>
  <li><strong>“Sunset / terrace”:</strong> set expectations (time, vibe, reservation rules).</li>
  <li><strong>“Group bookings”:</strong> clarify minimums, timing, and menu options.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Write a GBP Update post for a restaurant in [town], Mallorca.
Include: dish highlight, terrace/sunset angle (if relevant), and a booking CTA.
Max 1500 characters. Output EN + ES.
</code></pre>

<h3>Hotels</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Direct booking perks”:</strong> be specific and truthful (e.g., flexible check-in when available).</li>
  <li><strong>“Seasonal packages”:</strong> include real dates and conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>“Amenities spotlight”:</strong> beach access, spa, breakfast, parking, etc.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Write a GBP Offer post for a hotel in Mallorca.
Include: dates, conditions, and a direct booking CTA.
Avoid misleading pricing or "guaranteed" claims.
Output EN + DE.
</code></pre>

<h3>Local services (cleaning, trades, wellness)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>“Service area”:</strong> list towns you serve (Calvià, Palma, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>“Fast quote”:</strong> tell people what info you need for pricing.</li>
  <li><strong>“Trust”:</strong> licensing, insurance, years in Mallorca (only if true).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Write a GBP Update post for a local service business in Mallorca.
Include: service area, 3 trust signals we can prove, and a "request a quote" CTA.
Output EN + ES.
</code></pre>

<h2>Review reply matrix + examples (EN/ES/DE)</h2>
<p>Reviews are governed by Maps user-generated content policies and prohibited-content rules. Avoid fake engagement and don’t incentivize reviews. <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Positive review (example)</h3>
<p><strong>EN:</strong> Thank you for visiting us. We’re glad you enjoyed [specific detail]. If you’re back in [area], we’d love to welcome you again.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Gracias por visitarnos. Nos alegra que hayas disfrutado de [detalle]. Si vuelves por [zona], será un placer verte de nuevo.</p>
<p><strong>DE:</strong> Vielen Dank für Ihren Besuch. Es freut uns, dass Ihnen [Detail] gefallen hat. Wenn Sie wieder in [Gegend] sind, freuen wir uns auf Sie.</p>

<h3>Negative review (example)</h3>
<p><strong>EN:</strong> Thanks for the feedback. We’re sorry your experience didn’t match expectations. If you’re open to it, please contact us at [contact] so we can understand what happened and improve.</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Gracias por tu comentario. Sentimos que la experiencia no haya sido la esperada. Si quieres, contáctanos en [contacto] para entender lo ocurrido y mejorar.</p>
<p><strong>DE:</strong> Vielen Dank für Ihr Feedback. Es tut uns leid, dass Ihre Erfahrung nicht Ihren Erwartungen entsprach. Wenn Sie möchten, kontaktieren Sie uns unter [Kontakt], damit wir den Fall klären können.</p>

<h2>Handling suspicious or policy-violating reviews</h2>
<p>Not every review is fair. If a review includes prohibited content or appears to be fake engagement, document it and consider reporting it through the appropriate channels. Use the official policies as your reference for what is prohibited. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Measurement: tie GBP activity to results</h2>
<p>Local SEO becomes easier when you track outcomes. Add a simple weekly routine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Log what you posted (topic, date, CTA)</li>
  <li>Log review volume and sentiment trends</li>
  <li>Track calls, messages, and bookings that came after spikes in visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>If you also run ads, align your message across GBP, landing pages, and campaigns so users get the same promise everywhere.</p>

<h2>Website FAQs: the “Q&amp;A you control”</h2>
<p>Because Q&amp;A capabilities can change over time (and the Q&amp;A API is discontinued), the safest long-term approach is to build a FAQ system on your website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add 5-10 FAQs to your main service page (pricing boundaries, availability, locations)</li>
  <li>Publish one deeper guide per month and link the FAQs to it</li>
  <li>Reuse the same FAQ answers in your phone script and email replies</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduces repeated support messages and creates content that can rank. If you want examples of structured Q&amp;A formatting, browse the <a href="/qa">Q&amp;A page</a> and the <a href="/knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</a>.</p>

<h2>Local landing pages + internal links (avoid thin pages)</h2>
<p>If you serve multiple areas (Calvià, Santa Ponsa, Palma, etc.), don’t create dozens of near-duplicate pages. Instead, create a small set of high-quality location pages with real information: service boundaries, travel time expectations, parking, and seasonality. Then link them from relevant guides and from your main navigation where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Review request templates (policy-safe)</h2>
<p>A review system is more effective when it is consistent. The important constraint: avoid fake engagement. Don’t offer incentives for reviews and don’t filter who you ask based on sentiment. Use official policy guidance as your guardrail. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In person:</strong> “If you found this helpful, would you mind leaving a review on Google? It helps local businesses like us in Mallorca.”</li>
  <li><strong>WhatsApp:</strong> “Thanks again for visiting. If you have 30 seconds, here’s our Google review link: [link].”</li>
  <li><strong>Email:</strong> “How was your experience? Your feedback helps us improve. Leave a review here: [link].”</li>
</ul>
<p>Use AI to translate these into EN/ES/DE, but keep the meaning the same and never add discounts, competitions, or pressure language.</p>
<p>Operationally, treat reviews as a feedback channel: tag recurring issues (waiting time, cleanliness, communication), assign fixes, and then watch whether new reviews reflect the improvements.</p>
<p>Over time, this turns reputation work into measurable operations.</p>

<p><strong>Internal links to expand your local SEO system:</strong> start with <a href="/article/local-seo-mallorca">Local SEO Mallorca</a>, then improve your profile basics in <a href="/article/google-business-profile-mallorca">Google Business Profile Mallorca</a> and your response strategy in <a href="/article/google-reviews-calvia-business">Google Reviews for Calvià businesses</a>.</p>

      'A 30-day AI-assisted content calendar you can actually execute: daily prompts, repurposing rules, and a Mallorca-first workflow across social, GBP, and SEO.',
    content: `<p><strong>An AI content calendar</strong> only works if it matches your capacity. The fastest way to grow traffic is to publish consistently with a repeatable format, then compound wins with internal links and updates. This calendar is designed for Mallorca local businesses that want a realistic “1 hour per day” routine.</p>

<p>We’ll use AI to draft, but we’ll follow people-first content principles: accuracy, usefulness, and local relevance. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>The 3-channel calendar (simple and sustainable)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Social:</strong> short posts that build awareness and proof</li>
  <li><strong>Google Business Profile:</strong> weekly posts (updates/offers/events) <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Website/SEO:</strong> 1 weekly “asset” (FAQ, guide, or landing page section)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rules that keep the calendar from becoming “AI noise”</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Use real inputs:</strong> real prices, real availability, real photos.</li>
  <li><strong>One topic per week:</strong> don’t scatter across unrelated themes.</li>
  <li><strong>Repurpose:</strong> 1 idea becomes 5 outputs (post, story, GBP update, FAQ, email snippet).</li>
  <li><strong>Always add a next step:</strong> call, book, ask a question, save the post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prompt: generate your weekly theme pack</h2>
<pre><code>Create a 7-day theme pack for my business.

Business: [type], location: [town], audience: [tourists/residents], languages: [EN/ES/DE]
Weekly theme: [example: "sunset dinners", "family friendly", "winter offers"]

Output:
1) 7 social post ideas (hook + caption + CTA)
2) 1 GBP post (Update) + 1 GBP post (Offer or Event)
3) 5 FAQ questions for the website

<h2>Choose 3-5 content pillars (so you don’t run out of ideas)</h2>
<p>A calendar works when it reflects the same themes your customers care about. Pick a small set of “pillars” and rotate them:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Offer:</strong> what you sell and how it works</li>
  <li><strong>Proof:</strong> reviews, case studies, before/after, partner credibility</li>
  <li><strong>Local:</strong> Mallorca context (areas, seasons, parking, travel tips)</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ:</strong> pricing boundaries, availability, booking rules, languages</li>
  <li><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> quality and process (without hype)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Repurposing matrix: 1 idea becomes 5 outputs</h2>
<p>To keep workload low, build a repurposing habit:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write one social post (caption + hook)</li>
  <li>Turn it into a GBP post (shorter, direct CTA) <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
  <li>Turn it into a FAQ answer on the website</li>
  <li>Turn it into an email snippet (for weekly newsletter)</li>
  <li>Add 2 internal links between related pages</li>
</ol>

<h2>Mallorca “shot list” (so AI has real material)</h2>
<p>AI can’t replace real photos and local proof. Keep a simple shot list for your phone:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exterior + entrance (helps visitors find you)</li>
  <li>Top 5 products/services (consistent angles)</li>
  <li>Team/process (quality signals)</li>
  <li>Seasonal context (winter vs summer demand)</li>
  <li>Proof: testimonials, screenshots (with permission), awards (only if real)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weekly batching workflow (90 minutes, once per week)</h2>
<p>If daily posting feels heavy, batch your work on one day and schedule it:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pick the weekly theme:</strong> one pillar (offer, proof, local, FAQ, BTS).</li>
  <li><strong>Collect assets:</strong> 10-20 photos/videos from your shot list.</li>
  <li><strong>Draft captions in one run:</strong> ask AI for 7 variations and pick the best 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Create 2 GBP posts:</strong> 1 Update + 1 Offer/Event if relevant. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Write 5 FAQs:</strong> publish them on your site and link from the relevant page.</li>
  <li><strong>Schedule + publish:</strong> keep one “spare” post for unexpected situations (weather, closures, sold-out days).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prompt: repurpose one idea into 10 assets</h2>
<pre><code>Repurpose this single idea into 10 marketing assets.

Idea:
[paste]

Business: [type], location: [town, Mallorca], languages: [EN/ES/DE]
Voice: [paste 3-5 traits]

Output:
1) 3 Instagram captions (short / medium / long)
2) 1 TikTok script (30 seconds)
3) 1 GBP Update post (max 1500 chars)
4) 3 FAQ questions + answers (80-120 words each)
5) 1 email snippet (120-180 words)
</code></pre>
<p>To improve quality, keep prompts structured and include constraints and real facts. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Keyword placement (without keyword stuffing)</h2>
<p>When you turn a social idea into a website asset, don’t “sprinkle keywords”. Instead, pick one clear topic and write the page so it fully answers the question. Google’s people-first guidance emphasizes usefulness and avoiding content created primarily for search engines. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li>Put the topic in the title and H1 (natural language)</li>
  <li>Mention the location only when relevant (Calvià, Santa Ponsa, Mallorca)</li>
  <li>Use headings to structure the answer (H2/H3)</li>
  <li>Add internal links to related pages using descriptive anchor text</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internal linking mini-checklist (weekly)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Link the new asset from one existing high-traffic page</li>
  <li>Add 2 links from the new asset to relevant guides</li>
  <li>Update one old article with a link to the new asset</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example weekly theme (Mallorca off-season)</h2>
<p>If you’re a tourism business, off-season content can keep you top-of-mind for residents and early planners. Example theme: <strong>“Winter weekend escapes in Calvià”</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Social post:</strong> “3 reasons winter in Mallorca is underrated” + 1 local photo</li>
  <li><strong>GBP Update:</strong> “Open this weekend” + clear hours + booking CTA <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Website asset:</strong> “What to do in Calvià in winter” mini-guide + FAQs</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach keeps your content useful and avoids fake urgency. It also gives you something to update annually with real dates and new recommendations.</p>

<h2>Quality gate: the 5-minute human review</h2>
<p>Before you publish any AI-assisted post, do a quick review pass:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Facts:</strong> locations, dates, prices, hours are correct</li>
  <li><strong>Tone:</strong> matches your brand voice (not generic)</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> the first sentence says what the post is about</li>
  <li><strong>CTA:</strong> one clear next step (book, call, ask)</li>
  <li><strong>Spam check:</strong> remove repetitive keywords and filler</li>
</ul>
<p>If your team is small, write these rules down once and reuse them. A simple checklist is usually more effective than an overly complex “strategy deck”.</p>

<h2>Where this calendar connects to SEO (not just social)</h2>
<p>Each week, take 1 post and turn it into a small website asset (FAQ section, location page improvement, or a short guide). Over time, you build topical authority and internal links. This aligns with Google’s people-first guidance: publish helpful, reliable content instead of automation designed purely for rankings. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Start with <a href="/knowledge-base">the Knowledge Base</a> and the <a href="/category/ai-marketing">AI Marketing</a> category hub. Then link each new page to one “pillar” guide and 2-3 supporting pages. This is how small businesses build compounding traffic without posting random content every day. If you do this consistently for 90 days, you’ll have a real library.</p>

    slug: 'ai-email-marketing-tourism-segmentation-language-season',
    excerpt:
      'A practical email marketing system for Mallorca tourism brands: segment by language and season, draft with AI, stay compliant, and improve deliverability.',
    content: `<p><strong>AI email marketing for tourism</strong> is powerful in Mallorca because demand is seasonal and audiences are multilingual. AI helps you draft variants quickly, but you still need consent, clear messaging, and deliverability fundamentals.</p>

<p>This guide shows a simple segmentation model you can implement in most email tools, plus prompt templates to draft emails in English, Spanish, and German.</p>
<p>If you’re building a full AI marketing system (not just email), start with our <a href="/article/ai-marketing-mallorca-businesses-2026-playbook">AI Marketing Mallorca playbook</a>.</p>

<h2>1) Compliance baseline (GDPR)</h2>
<p>If you market to EU residents, GDPR is the baseline legal framework. Make sure you have a lawful basis for marketing emails (typically consent), provide unsubscribe options, and keep records appropriate to your setup. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>2) Deliverability baseline (bulk sender requirements)</h2>
<p>Deliverability is not optional. Google has described new requirements for bulk senders (authentication, easy unsubscribe, and keeping spam rates low). Even if you’re smaller than bulk thresholds, following these rules is good practice. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>3) The Mallorca tourism segmentation model (simple)</h2>
<p>Start with two dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Language:</strong> EN / ES / DE (based on preference or booking language)</li>
  <li><strong>Season stage:</strong> Pre-season, High season, Shoulder, Off-season</li>
</ul>

<p>Most email tools support saved segments with rules/conditions (Mailchimp segments, Klaviyo segment conditions, etc.). <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Example segments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>EN + Pre-season: people who visited the booking page in the last 90 days</li>
  <li>DE + High season: previous guests from Germany + upcoming travel dates</li>
  <li>ES + Off-season: locals/expats + weekend offers</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) AI prompt: multilingual seasonal campaign</h2>
<pre><code>Write 3 emails for a Mallorca tourism business.

Business: [hotel/boat tours/spa], location: [town]
Segment: [EN/ES/DE] + [pre-season/high/shoulder/off-season]
Offer: [what you're promoting]
Constraints:
- No misleading pricing
- Clear CTA (book/call)
- Include an unsubscribe sentence for the footer
- Tone: calm, premium, not hype

Output:
Email 1: Subject + preview + body (200-350 words)
Email 2: Subject + preview + body (200-350 words)
Email 3: Subject + preview + body (200-350 words)
</code></pre>

<h2>5) AI prompt: language QA and brand consistency</h2>
<pre><code>Review these emails for:
1) Clarity
2) Tone consistency with our brand voice
3) Translation quality (natural phrasing)
4) Potential compliance issues (claims, privacy, unsubscribe)

Brand voice: [paste]
Emails:
[paste]
</code></pre>

<h2>6) What to measure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bookings/revenue (if trackable)</li>
  <li>Reply rate (for concierge-style sequences)</li>
  <li>Spam complaints and unsubscribes (deliverability health) <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2>7) Build your list ethically (and make it multilingual)</h2>
<p>Tourism email marketing only works if your list is built on permission. Make it easy to subscribe, make the value clear, and keep expectations honest (frequency + content). GDPR is the baseline for EU data protection. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Practical list-building ideas for Mallorca tourism businesses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>WiFi opt-in:</strong> ask guests if they want local tips + updates (clear consent).</li>
  <li><strong>Booking opt-in:</strong> add a checkbox for marketing (separate from booking emails).</li>
  <li><strong>Local guide lead magnet:</strong> “Best beaches near Calvià”, “Rainy day checklist”, “Kids-friendly spots”.</li>
  <li><strong>In-person QR:</strong> table tents, reception signage, tour vans (always include consent language).</li>
</ul>

<h2>8) The 4 core tourism email flows (Mallorca-ready)</h2>
<p>Instead of “random newsletters”, build flows that match the guest journey. Use AI to draft variants by language and season, then review and improve.</p>

<h3>Flow A: Pre-arrival (reduce uncertainty)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subject: “Your Mallorca plan: parking, timing, and what to bring”</li>
  <li>Content: arrival directions, what’s included, what to expect, cancellation policy</li>
  <li>CTA: confirm booking, add extras, send questions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flow B: In-stay / In-trip (upsell without pressure)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subject: “If you have 2 hours today…”</li>
  <li>Content: one curated recommendation, one offer, one “save” tip</li>
  <li>CTA: book add-on, reserve table, schedule spa slot</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flow C: Post-stay (reviews + referrals)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subject: “Thank you, and one quick question”</li>
  <li>Content: thank you, review request (no incentives), referral ask</li>
  <li>CTA: leave a review, reply with feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flow D: Win-back (off-season + shoulder season)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Subject: “Mallorca in the quieter months: our favorite weekends”</li>
  <li>Content: seasonal angle, availability windows, resident-friendly offers</li>
  <li>CTA: check dates, request a quote, ask for recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) AI prompt pack (flows + language variants)</h2>
<p>Use one master prompt to generate the flow, then a second prompt to QA translation and tone.</p>

<pre><code>Write a 4-email flow for a Mallorca tourism business.

Business: [hotel/tours/spa], location: [town], audience: [tourists/residents]
Flow: [pre-arrival / in-stay / post-stay / win-back]
Language: [EN/ES/DE]
Tone: calm, premium, helpful (no hype)

Constraints:
- No misleading pricing
- Include clear CTA
- Mention key conditions (dates, cancellation)
- Respect privacy and consent

Output:
Email 1-4:
- Subject (max 50 chars)
- Preview text (max 90 chars)
- Body (200-350 words)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>QA these emails for:
1) Translation naturalness (not literal)
2) Tone consistency
3) Any risky claims (prices, guarantees)
4) Any missing conditions (dates, exclusions)

Paste the final "approved" versions.
</code></pre>

<h2>10) Deliverability checklist (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)</h2>
<p>Deliverability determines whether emails reach the inbox. Google has described authentication and low spam rates as part of sender requirements, and Google Workspace Admin docs explain SPF, DKIM, and DMARC setup concepts. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SPF:</strong> authorized sending servers</li>
  <li><strong>DKIM:</strong> cryptographic signing for your domain</li>
  <li><strong>DMARC:</strong> policy + reporting for alignment</li>
  <li><strong>Unsubscribe:</strong> make it obvious and easy</li>
</ul>

<h2>11) Seasonality: write emails that match real travel intent</h2>
<p>In Mallorca, the same email can perform very differently across seasons. Use AI to draft seasonal variations, but keep the offer honest. Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pre-season:</strong> “Plan now” guides, flexible booking messaging, early availability windows</li>
  <li><strong>High season:</strong> “Limited availability” only when true, clear conditions, fast booking paths</li>
  <li><strong>Off-season:</strong> locals + weekend angles, experiential content, calm tone</li>
</ul>

<h2>12) Segment naming + rules (so you can actually run campaigns)</h2>
<p>Segments get messy when you don’t name them clearly. Whether you use Mailchimp or Klaviyo, a good segment name includes language + season stage + intent. Both platforms document how segments and conditions work. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EN / Pre-season / Website visitors:</strong> visited booking page in last 30-90 days</li>
  <li><strong>DE / High season / Past guests:</strong> booked last year + opened emails recently</li>
  <li><strong>ES / Off-season / Locals:</strong> Mallorca residents + weekend interest</li>
</ul>

<h2>13) Personalization without being creepy</h2>
<p>AI makes personalization easy, but that doesn’t mean you should personalize everything. Keep it simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use language preference and season stage (high value, low risk)</li>
  <li>Personalize by interest category (spa, family, couples, adventure) only if it is clearly opted-in</li>
  <li>Avoid sensitive personal data and avoid guessing (no “we noticed you…” tone)</li>
</ul>

<h2>14) Testing plan (A/B) you can run monthly</h2>
<p>Instead of testing everything, test one variable at a time:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subject line angle:</strong> guide vs offer vs proof</li>
  <li><strong>CTA:</strong> “Book now” vs “Check dates” vs “Reply with questions”</li>
  <li><strong>Language style:</strong> formal vs friendly (especially in DE/ES)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Create 10 subject line variations for this email.

Email goal: [bookings/replies/reviews]
Segment: [EN/ES/DE + season stage]
Tone: calm, premium, no hype

Output:
- 5 subject lines focused on a guide/value angle
- 5 subject lines focused on a specific offer angle
Each max 50 characters.
</code></pre>

<h2>15) Example: post-stay email (English)</h2>
<p>Use this as a starting point, then generate ES/DE variants and review for natural phrasing.</p>
<pre><code>Subject: Thank you for visiting Mallorca
Preview: One quick question to help us improve

Hi [First name],

Thank you again for visiting us in [town]. We hope you had a great experience.

If you have 30 seconds, would you share honest feedback in a Google review?
[review link]

If something wasn’t perfect, you can also reply to this email and tell us what happened. We read every message and use it to improve.

Warmly,
[Business name]</code></pre>

<h2>16) Data hygiene: protect deliverability and trust</h2>
<p>Email performance drops when lists get stale. Poor hygiene can increase bounces and spam complaints, which harms deliverability. Google has emphasized spam rate and authentication requirements for senders. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove hard bounces</strong> automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Re-engage</strong> inactive subscribers with one calm email, then stop emailing if they don’t respond.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefer quality over quantity:</strong> fewer, more useful emails beat weekly noise.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep preferences simple:</strong> let people choose language and frequency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt: re-engagement email (no guilt, no hype)</h3>
<pre><code>Write a re-engagement email for a Mallorca tourism brand.

Language: [EN/ES/DE]
Tone: calm, respectful
Goal: confirm interest and update preferences (language + frequency)

Output:
Subject + preview + body (150-250 words)
</code></pre>

<h2>17) If you have booking data: segment by arrival date</h2>
<p>If your booking system stores arrival dates, you can create high-performing segments like “arriving in the next 7 days” or “arriving next month”. These emails are naturally useful and feel less like marketing:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>7 days before:</strong> directions, check-in rules, what to pack</li>
  <li><strong>2 days before:</strong> reminders, weather note, last-minute add-ons</li>
  <li><strong>During stay:</strong> concierge-style recommendations (one per day max)</li>
</ul>
<p>Use AI to draft the variants by language, but keep the content factual and aligned with your real policies.</p>
<p>Finally, give subscribers control: a simple preference link (language + frequency) reduces unsubscribes and keeps your list healthier long term.</p>
<p>If you’re more advanced, add one more dimension: trip type (families, couples, groups). Keep it optional and only if you can deliver genuinely different recommendations.</p>
<p>Start simple, measure engagement, then expand segments based on real behavior. This keeps your program sustainable year-round.</p>

    excerpt:
      'A practical AI-assisted review reply workflow for Mallorca businesses: policy-safe replies, escalation rules, templates, and a system that builds trust.',
    content: `<p><strong>AI reputation management</strong> should make your business more human, not less. The best workflow is simple: AI drafts, humans approve. This reduces response time while keeping tone, accuracy, and policy compliance.</p>

<h2>Why review replies matter</h2>
<p>Potential customers read reviews to reduce risk. A strong reply strategy improves trust, shows accountability, and can turn negative experiences into retained customers.</p>

<h2>Policy guardrails (avoid fake engagement)</h2>
<p>Google’s Maps user-generated content policies and prohibited-content rules are clear on the kinds of manipulation that are not allowed, including incentivized reviews and other forms of “fake engagement”. Don’t offer discounts for reviews and don’t filter who gets asked to review. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2>The Mallorca review-reply playbook</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Classify every review</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Positive:</strong> thank + specific detail + invite back</li>
  <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> acknowledge + clarify + invite next step</li>
  <li><strong>Negative:</strong> apologize + take responsibility (where appropriate) + propose resolution</li>
  <li><strong>Suspicious/off-topic:</strong> short, calm response + document + consider reporting if policy-violating</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Create a “voice rules” snippet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Length: 60-120 words</li>
  <li>No emojis</li>
  <li>No defensiveness</li>
  <li>Never share personal data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Use AI to draft two reply options</h3>
<pre><code>Write 2 reply options to this review.

Business: [type], location: [town in Mallorca]
Voice: [friendly/premium/direct]
Rules:
- Do not mention incentives for reviews
- Do not include personal data
- If negative: offer a resolution path (call/email)

Review:
[paste review]
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 4: Escalation rules (when to go manual)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Safety issues</li>
  <li>Legal threats</li>
  <li>Accusations of discrimination</li>
  <li>Claims about illness/injury</li>
</ul>

<h2>Templates you can paste today</h2>
<h3>Positive review reply</h3>
<pre><code>Thank you for visiting us, [Name/Guest]! We’re happy you enjoyed [specific detail].
If you’re back in [area], we’d love to welcome you again. </code></pre>

<h3>Negative review reply (service issue)</h3>
<pre><code>Thank you for the feedback. We’re sorry your experience didn’t match expectations.
This isn’t the standard we aim for. If you’re open to it, please contact us at [contact]
so we can understand what happened and make it right.</code></pre>

<h2>How to get more reviews (without breaking policy)</h2>
<p>More reviews come from consistency, not tricks. The key constraint is to avoid fake engagement: no incentives, no filtering who you ask, and no pressure language. Use official policy guidance as your guardrail. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Review request SOP (simple)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Ask everyone:</strong> after a completed service or visit, send the same request to all customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it easy:</strong> one short link or QR code.</li>
  <li><strong>Stay neutral:</strong> ask for “honest feedback”, not “5 stars”.</li>
  <li><strong>Reply fast:</strong> create trust by responding consistently.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn:</strong> log issues and fix the root cause.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Review request templates (EN/ES/DE)</h3>
<p><strong>EN:</strong> Thanks again for visiting. If you have 30 seconds, could you leave honest feedback on Google? [link]</p>
<p><strong>ES:</strong> Gracias de nuevo por tu visita. Si tienes 30 segundos, ¿podrías dejar una reseña honesta en Google? [enlace]</p>
<p><strong>DE:</strong> Vielen Dank nochmals für Ihren Besuch. Wenn Sie 30 Sekunden haben, würden Sie eine ehrliche Google-Bewertung hinterlassen? [Link]</p>

<h3>Staff script (30 seconds, no pressure)</h3>
<p>Train staff to ask in the same calm way. Consistency beats awkward “salesy” asking:</p>
<pre><code>If you have a moment later, we’d really appreciate honest feedback on Google.
It helps people find us in Mallorca. Here’s the link/QR. Thank you!</code></pre>
<p>Important: don’t ask only happy customers and don’t offer rewards. That can cross into fake engagement territory. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Handling negative reviews: the 4-part response</h2>
<p>A good negative-review reply is not a debate. It’s a trust-building response that shows accountability and gives a clear next step.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> confirm you read the feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Apologize (when appropriate):</strong> without admitting things that didn’t happen.</li>
  <li><strong>Clarify:</strong> short context if needed, without sounding defensive.</li>
  <li><strong>Resolve:</strong> offer a channel to fix it (phone/email).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prompt: negative review reply (calm + structured)</h3>
<pre><code>Write a reply to this negative review.

Rules:
- Calm, professional, no emojis
- 80-140 words
- Offer a next step (call/email)
- Do not share private details

Business: [type], Mallorca
Review: [paste]
</code></pre>

<h2>When to report a review (and when not to)</h2>
<p>Not every unfair review is removable, but some reviews violate policies (spam, hate, personal data, fake engagement, etc.). Google provides guidance on reporting reviews through your Business Profile. Use the policy pages to understand what qualifies. <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Replying at scale: your daily + weekly routine</h2>
<p>Google provides guidance on reading and replying to reviews. The operational goal is to keep response time low while maintaining quality. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily (10-20 minutes):</strong> reply to new negative reviews first, then detailed reviews.</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly (15 minutes):</strong> summarize themes and assign fixes (operations).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response time targets (practical)</h2>
<p>You don’t need perfection, but you do need consistency. A simple target system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Negative reviews:</strong> reply as soon as possible (same day if you can).</li>
  <li><strong>Neutral reviews:</strong> reply within a couple of days.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive detailed reviews:</strong> reply consistently, but not at the cost of service quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t reply daily, batch replies twice per week and use templates + AI drafting to stay consistent.</p>

<h3>Prompt: weekly reputation report (from raw reviews)</h3>
<pre><code>Summarize these reviews into a weekly reputation report.

Output:
1) Positive themes (top 3)
2) Negative themes (top 3)
3) Operational fixes to assign (top 5)
4) Suggested copy improvements (website/menus/policies)

Reviews:
[paste reviews]
</code></pre>

<h2>Multilingual replies (EN/ES/DE) without sounding translated</h2>
<p>If you serve tourists and residents, multilingual replies matter. Use AI to draft translations, then do a human pass for natural phrasing and cultural tone. Keep the message consistent and don’t add incentives or extra claims during translation. <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>Translate this review reply into ES and DE.

Rules:
- Natural phrasing (not literal)
- Keep length similar
- Keep tone calm and professional
- Do not add new information

Reply:
[paste]
</code></pre>

<h2>KPIs to track (so this becomes a system)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Response time:</strong> average hours to first reply</li>
  <li><strong>Rating trend:</strong> monthly average and volatility</li>
  <li><strong>Theme frequency:</strong> top repeated complaints and compliments</li>
  <li><strong>Escalations:</strong> number of reviews requiring manual investigation</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect reputation with local visibility workflows, also read <a href="/article/ai-local-seo-google-business-profile-posts-qa-review-replies">AI for Local SEO (GBP posts + reviews)</a>.</p>

<h2>Escalation matrix (who handles what)</h2>
<p>AI is not a decision maker. Define escalation rules so sensitive reviews go to a human owner fast.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Review type</th>
      <th>Response owner</th>
      <th>Goal</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1-2 stars, service complaint</td><td>Manager</td><td>Resolve + retain</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Safety / injury claim</td><td>Owner</td><td>Document + contact privately</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Legal threat</td><td>Owner</td><td>Calm reply + move to private channel</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Suspected fake review</td><td>Manager</td><td>Calm reply + consider reporting</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Positive detailed review</td><td>Staff template + human check</td><td>Build trust + invite back</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Build a reusable reply library (so every reply isn’t custom)</h2>
<p>Create 10 templates in your brand voice, then use AI to adapt them. This keeps tone consistent and speeds up replies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Positive (restaurant/hotel/service)</li>
  <li>Neutral</li>
  <li>Negative: waiting time</li>
  <li>Negative: pricing complaint</li>
  <li>Negative: cleanliness</li>
  <li>Negative: communication</li>
  <li>Fake/off-topic</li>
  <li>Complaint resolution request</li>
  <li>Thank you + return invitation</li>
  <li>Multilingual short version (EN/ES/DE)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prompt: turn templates into a full reply library</h3>
<pre><code>Create a review reply library for this Mallorca business.

Business: [type], location: [town]
Voice: [paste]
Templates needed: positive, neutral, negative (5 types), fake/off-topic, resolution, multilingual short replies.

Rules:
- Do not mention incentives for reviews
- Do not share private customer details
- Keep replies 60-140 words
</code></pre>

<h2>Handling suspected fake reviews (calm + policy-aligned)</h2>
<p>If a review seems fake, avoid accusations. Reply calmly, state you can’t locate the experience, and invite the reviewer to contact you. If it violates policy, consider reporting it using the official guidance. <sup><a href="#source-5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>Thanks for the feedback. We can’t find a record of this experience.
If you visited us, please contact [contact] with details so we can investigate and resolve it.</code></pre>

<h2>Turn reviews into marketing assets (with permission)</h2>
<p>Reviews are proof. With permission, you can reuse themes in your website copy and FAQs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a “What guests love” section (real themes, not invented claims)</li>
  <li>Turn repeated questions into an FAQ page</li>
  <li>Use review language to improve ad copy and landing pages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Copy-paste replies:</strong> templates should be adapted to include one specific detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Defensiveness:</strong> arguing publicly often reduces trust, even when you are right.</li>
  <li><strong>Over-sharing:</strong> never reveal private details about bookings, staff, or customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> don’t offer discounts or gifts for reviews (fake engagement risk). <sup><a href="#source-4">[4]</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Silence:</strong> not replying to negative reviews makes the worst feedback feel “true”.</li>
  <li><strong>No learning loop:</strong> if the same complaint repeats, fix operations, not just replies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How AI helps without harming trust</h2>
<p>Use AI to draft, translate, and structure responses, but keep a human approval step. This keeps your replies fast and consistent while preserving authenticity. If a reply involves policy issues or reporting, follow Google’s official review guidance and policies. <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Once the system is stable, you can reuse the same library for other channels (email, social DMs, support tickets) so your brand voice stays consistent everywhere. This also reduces training time for new staff and helps during peak season. It is a small system with a big impact.</p>

<h2>Connect reputation to local SEO</h2>
<p>Reputation management is part of local SEO. To go deeper, read <a href="/article/local-seo-mallorca">Local SEO Mallorca</a> and <a href="/article/google-reviews-calvia-business">Google reviews for Calvià businesses</a>. For Google Business Profile rules (names, addresses, content), review Google’s official guidelines. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
