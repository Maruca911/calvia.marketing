# Supabase (Template Only)

This folder contains SQL migration templates created during early development.

- They are **not used at runtime** by `calvia.marketing`.
- They do **nothing** unless you manually apply them to a Supabase project.
- Production deploys publish the static `dist/` output, so this folder is not shipped to the website.

Keep this as a reference template only.
